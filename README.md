Free media
==========

This repository contains a number of freely-reusable media (audio, image, and
video) files, primarily intended for use in live-stream alerts. Each one is
made available under a license which allows full reuse in commercial and
non-commercial contexts; some require acknowledgement.

Files listed as "CC-BY-SA 4.0/StilleBot" are available under all the terms of
the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license,
with the following additional exemption:

    Use of this file, unmodified, in a livestream alert provided by the StilleBot
    alert box, is permitted even without explicit attribution.

Attribution is still welcomed, of course :)


TODO:
* Create a landing page that lists all the files, with thumbnails
  - Autogenerate the actual content? Or fetch() it clientside and render the
    same way that StilleBot does?
* Expand the collection. Pick out some useful sounds, to save people the
  trouble of searching? Or just omit that.
* Collaborate with an artist to make some decent animations
* Write a script to (re)build the JSON file. Make it a pre-commit hook.

----------------

I discussed this briefly on stream with you a little while back. The idea is
to have a set of default alerts that anyone can use. As such, this isn't a
normal commission; to be useful, these will have to be freely licensed. If
you're not comfortable with literally anyone on the internet being able to
use these alerts, don't accept this commission :) I'm fine with paying a
premium for this permission.

My intention is to release this set under the terms of CC-BY-SA 4.0,
https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/ - with an additional
exemption: use unchanged as an alert in StilleBot does not require
attribution (normally, it's only legal to take and use these if you properly
identify the creators). I'll encourage, but not require, people who use these
alerts to say something in their panels about you (for the art) and me (for
the code).

So! The alerts that I have in mind are:
- Subscription (including resub). A long bread roll, progressively filled with
  ingredients, to make a sub sandwich. Doesn't need to be very animated, just
  start with the sliced-open bread roll, then one frame each to add ingredients.
  Open to discussion as to what should go on the sandwich :)

- Gift sub. Lift the lid on a festive box, then the sub (from the last frame of
  the previous one) rises out of it.

- Raid. Parachutes descending. Kinda like a massive group !drop or something.

- Cheer. A fairly generic sparkle and hype, maybe a tube with fireworks-style
  sparkles coming out of it. I can't use Twitch's assets here so there'll be
  just a single animation regardless of the size of cheer.

All are fairly flexible ideas, feel free to take them in any direction you like.
