Free media
==========

This repository contains a number of freely-reusable media (audio, image, and
video) files, primarily intended for use in live-stream alerts. Each one is
made available under a license which allows full reuse in commercial and
non-commercial contexts; some require acknowledgement.

Files listed as "CC-BY-SA 4.0/StilleBot" are available under all the terms of
the [CC-BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license,
with the following additional exemption:

    Use of this file, unmodified, in a livestream alert provided by the StilleBot
    alert box, is permitted even without explicit attribution.

Attribution is still welcomed, of course :)


TODO:
* Create a landing page that lists all the files, with thumbnails
  - Autogenerate the actual content? Or fetch() it clientside and render the
    same way that StilleBot does?
* Expand the collection. Pick out some useful sounds, to save people the
  trouble of searching? Or just omit that.
* Collaborate with an artist to make some decent animations
* Write a script to (re)build the JSON file. Make it a pre-commit hook.
